On June 7, 2017 several Rubyist from the Denton area met at a local co-working space, Denton. This meetup event was initialized by Dave Sims to get other fellow and upcoming developers together as a kick off session. I have been living in the surrounding Denton area for about 2 years and started to get involved in the development community a bit over a year ago. <br>
Needless to say I was exited to have seen this event show up on the Techmill website. It may have been a huge coincidence that I have started to learn Ruby and I was looking forward to seeing what this area has to offer. <br>
The first meeting was very welcoming and Dave wanted to hear what, we, the Ruby community wanted to get out of this group. After brief introductions we all learned that we have a mix of new to very senior Rubyists. For now, it will be mentor-focused and discover ways in which we can all help each other. <br>
So, for now I will continue to explore this framework and look forward to the next meetup event.<br>
